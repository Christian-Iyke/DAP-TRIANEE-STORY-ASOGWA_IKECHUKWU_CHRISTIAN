<td>Data Analysis Project LP1 -- Indian Start-up Funding Analysis</td>
<td>Data Analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, processing, and modeling data to extract meaningful insights and use the information from the insights to make decisions.

In this project, analysis of funding received by start-ups in India startup ecosystem from 2018 to 2021 datasets was used. </td>

<td> </td>
<td> Streamlit is an open-source tool to build and deploy data applications with less coding compared to other front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a low-code tool specifically designed for building data science applications. Moreover, the Streamlit library has functions and methods in pure Python to develop data applications with minimal code. Streamlit also supports various database connections, like AWS S3, MS SQL Server, Oracle DB, spreadsheets, etc. We will divide the article into three parts: the first part takes you through Streamlitâ€™s core APIs, followed by Streamlit cloud deployment, and in the last part, we will build the Streamlit app to predict road traffic accident severity with code snippets. So, let us delve into the streamlit library to create data web applications.</td>

<td>Hugging Face is an open-source and platform provider of machine learning technologies. You can install their package to access some interesting pre-built models to use them directly or to fine-tune (retrain it on your dataset leveraging the prior knowledge coming with the first training), then host your trained models on the platform, so that you may use them later on other devices and apps. </td>

<td>Sepsis Sentiment Analysis API Building Using FastAPI.</td>
<td>Machine learning models can be consumed as restful APIs. Mostly, the real use of your ML model lies at the heart of an intelligent product â€“ that may be a small component of a recommender system or an intelligent chat-bot. These seem very difficult to overcome as the majority of ML practitioners use R/Python for their experiments whilst consumers of those ML models would be software engineers who use a completely different technology stack. This problem can be easily solved with building of APIs. Web APIs have made it easy for cross-language applications to work well. If a frontend developer needs to use your ML Model to create an ML powered web application, they would just need to get the URL Endpoint from where the API is being served. In this project, we will build an ML model, create a restful API for the model and finally containerized the application with Docker. </td>

Your client has collected transactional data for the year 2019 but hasnâ€™t been able to put it to good use. The client hopes you can analyze the data and put together a report to help them find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.</td>
